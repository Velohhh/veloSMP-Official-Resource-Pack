## Why? What?

veloEnhanced is a resource pack I use when I play survival Minecraft.
Originally, it was used for a personal minecraft SMP server of mine as the official resource pack. But now, it's just a resource pack that everyone can use.

## Where do you get these textures from?
70% of the textures used here are made by me. The rest is a mash-up of some authorized and some unauthorized resource packs that other people have made.

## Why on GitHub?
If I posted the resource pack on PMC or CurseForge I think it would get taken down because there's a good amount of unauthorized assets used here.

## WHY ARE YOU STILL USING OPTIFINE!!?!!!?
Here's why:
- Optifine is somehow still much faster than Sodium + Lithium + Phosphor for me
- Optifine has CIT, CTM, CEM, etc.
- Personal choice
