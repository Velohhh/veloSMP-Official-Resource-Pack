# Introduction

Hello! Welcome to the official website of veloEnhanced. veloEnhanced is a Minecraft Resource Pack maintained by veloLib. It is the official resource pack for veloLib's Minecraft server.

# Is the resource pack seriously maintained by only 1 person?

Sadly, yes. It will stay like that until I become friends with someone who actually knows how resource packs work. It's like that because I don't really trust anyone that doesn't know how resource packs work to contribute.

# I'd like to contribute!

If you really want to contribute, you can do it simply by requesting a texture! I will explain this more deeply later :).

# How do I make an issue?

It's actually really easy, here are the steps:

1. Join the [discord.](bit.ly/velodiscord)
2. Go to the #◆》server-info channel.
3. React to the ticket.

# Credits

The credits are actually in the CREDITS.md file, but I'm just gonna copy them here.
